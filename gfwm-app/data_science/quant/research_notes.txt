compare apples to apples, ie sp500 benchmark should include same cash percent as portfolio
when adding the bond fund, compare (esg stocks - esg bond - cash) to (sp500 - regular bonds - cash)
also have toggle to switch between market cap sp500 and equal weight sp500
make risk slider give both esg and benchmark portfolio the same cash / bond allocation
    also be able to adjust while editing portfolio content
